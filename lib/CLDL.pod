=head CLYDESDALE

Clydesdale: A workhorse.

Clydesdale is an application framework written in Perl using the Dancer2 framework.  You can use it as the base for your CRUD application.  Add/Edit data to tables, create menus and manage user access.  The entire application is data driven from the database.  Data is cached using Redis so your application will be very fast.

It's designed to be readable, maintainable, modifiable and a lot of other "able" things.
