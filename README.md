# Clydesdale

Clydesdale is an application framework written in Perl usng the Dancer2 framework.  As the name implies, Clydesdale is a work-horst.  You can use it as a CRUD application.  Add/Edit data to tables, create menus and manage user access.  It's all menu driven.  The entire pplication is data driven from the database.  

The application does not use any ORM.  So, even a novice can pick it up and run with it.

As this is the initial relaase, everything is data driven.  Eventually, we plan on generating Dancer2 Plugins.  So, the idea is to make it much faster and to tolerate higher workloads.
